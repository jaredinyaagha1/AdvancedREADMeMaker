# Advanced READMe Maker

# Description
### This application is designed to make writing READMes a breeze! It's a command line based application that I created using Javascript, so all of the action takes place in the console. I wanted to make it easy to use, so after it's done generating the markdown file, all you have to do is change the name of it and put it in your desired location.
